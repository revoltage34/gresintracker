# Genshin Impact Resin Tracker
A small Python GUI that track Genshin Impact Resin externally.

You still need to change the Resin amount everytime you used it. But now you can check your Resin with this instead of opening the game or even remembering it yourself.

Resin can go above the limit, telling you how much Resin overflowed. Pain.

Still track correctly with either the program closed or open.

Actual Resin value might be differ by up to 1 Resin (~8 min or less).
